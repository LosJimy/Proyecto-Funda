Grammar

Rule 0     S' -> expression
Rule 1     expression -> expression + expression
Rule 2     expression -> NUMBER
Rule 3     expression -> STRING

Terminals, with rules where they appear

+                    : 1
NUMBER               : 2
STRING               : 3
error                : 

Nonterminals, with rules where they appear

expression           : 1 1 0

Parsing method: LALR

state 0

    (0) S' -> . expression
    (1) expression -> . expression + expression
    (2) expression -> . NUMBER
    (3) expression -> . STRING

    NUMBER          shift and go to state 2
    STRING          shift and go to state 3

    expression                     shift and go to state 1

state 1

    (0) S' -> expression .
    (1) expression -> expression . + expression

    +               shift and go to state 4


state 2

    (2) expression -> NUMBER .

    +               reduce using rule 2 (expression -> NUMBER .)
    $end            reduce using rule 2 (expression -> NUMBER .)


state 3

    (3) expression -> STRING .

    +               reduce using rule 3 (expression -> STRING .)
    $end            reduce using rule 3 (expression -> STRING .)


state 4

    (1) expression -> expression + . expression
    (1) expression -> . expression + expression
    (2) expression -> . NUMBER
    (3) expression -> . STRING

    NUMBER          shift and go to state 2
    STRING          shift and go to state 3

    expression                     shift and go to state 5

state 5

    (1) expression -> expression + expression .
    (1) expression -> expression . + expression

  ! shift/reduce conflict for + resolved as shift
    $end            reduce using rule 1 (expression -> expression + expression .)
    +               shift and go to state 4

  ! +               [ reduce using rule 1 (expression -> expression + expression .) ]
